# Two Way Trello Synchronization using AWS Serverless

## **Overview**
The Trello Sync Project is a robust Node.js application designed to synchronize Trello cards between different boards. It offers real-time, two-way synchronization of card fields like names, descriptions, labels, and due dates, while providing scalability and automation through AWS Lambda deployment. With advanced conflict resolution, error handling, and event-driven updates, this tool ensures efficient management of Trello workflows.

---

## **Features**
- **Two-Way Synchronization**: Automatically updates the most recently modified card while keeping the other in sync.
- **Field-Level Sync**: Syncs additional fields, including labels, due dates, and checklists.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Integrates with Trello Webhooks for event-driven synchronization.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Uses hash-based comparisons and timestamps to handle simultaneous edits.
- **Retry Mechanism**: Handles API rate limits with retry logic and exponential backoff.
- **Advanced Logging**: Captures detailed logs for debugging and auditing purposes.
- **Cloud Deployment**: Fully deployable on AWS Lambda with an AWS SAM template for infrastructure management.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Programming Language**: Node.js
- **Frameworks & Libraries**:
  - `axios`: For HTTP requests to the Trello API.
  - `dotenv`: For managing environment variables.
- **Cloud Services**:
  - AWS Lambda: For serverless execution.
  - AWS CloudWatch: For monitoring and logging.
- **Trello API**: To interact with Trello cards and boards.
